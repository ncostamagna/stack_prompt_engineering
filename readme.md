## Formul

- consider the context of your prompt how do you want GPT to engage with you.

  - Chat GPT, which has a short memory, ignores all previous questions.
  - You can request Chat GPT that act as some professional, for example novelist, english teacher, etc..
    - "I want you to act as a novelist. ..."

- Be specific

## reverse prompting

Reverse prompt engineering allows you to take existing texts or codes and generate new content based on those inputs.
< br />
for example:

```
Given Text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
Reverse prompt: "Write a story a quick brown fox and a lazy dog"

Me:
creating a reverse prompt enginner with "You can learn golang or nodejs, python is a good option too, you can learn in Udemy"

ChatGTP:
"If someone wants to learn programming, what are some recommended options and platforms, such as Udemy, for learning Golang, Node.js, and Python?"

```

## Chat GTP 4

More reasoning and conciseness but less spedd <br />
We can use with photos (for the time being)

## Limitation
